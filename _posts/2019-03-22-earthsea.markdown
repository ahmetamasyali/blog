I finished first book of Earthsea Cycle - A Wizard of Earthsea. It was the most enjoyable book since a very long time. 

Spoiler : 

The book is about a boy, who is studying witchcraft. At some point he mades a forbidden spell. And He summons a creature from darkness by mistake. From now on he runs from the creature or the creature runs from him.
At the end of the book he emerges with the creature and become one again. 

Message is we all have a dark side. If we do not accept it , we cant be a complete person. Writer thinks that, 
we do not finish growing until we accept our dark side.
